The user has approved the previous approach. I will proceed to implement the fix to prevent PM2 restarts when taking screenshots.

1.  **Modify `bot.js`**:
    *   Import `os` module.
    *   Update the screenshot logic to save the file in `os.tmpdir()` instead of `__dirname`. This places the temporary file outside the project directory, preventing PM2 from detecting a change and restarting the app.

2.  **Modify `ecosystem.config.js`**:
    *   Add `*.png` and `temp` to the `ignore_watch` array as a secondary safety measure.

This ensures the bot stays online while taking and sending screenshots.
